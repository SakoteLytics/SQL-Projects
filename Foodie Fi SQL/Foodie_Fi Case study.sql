monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

--This is the growth rate for Foodie_Fi in 2020 - MRR- Monthly Recurring Revenue

--2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

--Total active subscribers
--Monthly subscriber growth rate
--monthly recurring revenue
--churn rate
--new subscriber per month
--Trial-to-paid conversion rate
--average revenue per user (ARPU)
--Average subscription Duration/customer lifetime
--Revenue by plan type
--churn reason analysis.SURVEY WORKS



--3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

--Trial conversion Journey
--Plan upgrade/downgrade patterns
--subscription longetivity plan
--Churn timing


--4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?

--what is the main reason you are canceling your subscription? Multiple-choice
--On a scale of 1-5, how satisfied were you with your foodie-fi experience
--would you consider resubscribing in the future? (Yes, No, Maybe)
--what could we improve to make you stay? Open-ended


--5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
